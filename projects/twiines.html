# sorts milestones and stones in the timeline view based on value. Instead of separating them out, and having
# two loops showing milestones and stones this allows the view to render them all together and sort them accordingly.

	def combined_stone_mstone
		milestone_objects = self.milestones.all
		stone_objects = self.stones.all

		@combined_timeline_objects = milestone_objects + stone_objects

		@combined_timeline_objects = @combined_timeline_objects.sort {|m,s| s.sort_value <=> m.sort_value}
